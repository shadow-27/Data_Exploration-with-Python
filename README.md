# Data_Exploration-with-Python
In this Project I learn the basics of Python and follow  FreeCodeCamp Course to learn Data Analysis using python.
I used a salesdata of Cycle shop which was provided in that lecture and then learnt all the basics of Data exploration using PANDAS and tried to make graphs using MATPLOT library to derive some insights on what kind of data I'm working on and check if there is some dirty data.
